# 👋 Hi, I'm Mel Mazaiwana

### 💡 AI Strategist | Data Scientist | Founder @ AI Solutions LLC

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm passionate about helping organizations especially small and mid-sized businesses adopt and deploy AI solutions that **actually work**. With 12+ years of experience spanning government and private sectors, I now specialize in **AI implementation strategy**, **data engineering**, and **human-centered AI adoption**.

Currently pursuing my Master’s in Data Science at Harvard (Class of 2026), I’m focused on real-world, responsible AI solutions with lasting impact.
